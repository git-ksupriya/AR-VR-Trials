# AR-VR-Trials
A total beginner's entry into Unity and AR-VR.

About the Project \n
This repository documents my first steps into the world of AR and VR using Unity. As a total beginner, I’m exploring the basics, experimenting with features, and learning by doing.

What to Expect
Messy code and experiments (since I’m learning!)
Progress updates as I refine my skills.

Why This Repository Exists
To track my growth, share my journey, and (hopefully) inspire others who are just starting out with AR/VR development.

Feedback Welcome
If you’re experienced in Unity or AR/VR, feel free to suggest improvements or point out best practices. I would really appreciate it.

Disclaimer
This is a learning project. Expect imperfections, and watch this space for updates as I learn and grow!
